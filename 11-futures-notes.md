- after each episode: summarize on the blackboard
- no AI, but societal/work questions

Start
- Lack of diversity (in leadership) still an issue
- Persistent company culture: desire of those in charge to be comfortable.
- Need to embrace the feeling of uncomfortable. Related to diversity and risk.
(Need to be aware that a "comfort-culture" may not contribute to diversity.)

6 minutes
- How to encourage learning (questioning how things are done)
- Cost of uncomfortable: perception of friction
- Who benefits? (do we allow all uncomfortableness into our work? - destructive leadership)

10 minutes
- Encouraging disagreements/challenging thoughts in teams
- Coworkers who criticize can be the "canaries in the coalmine" or an "irritant"

11:20 minutes
- Future of leadership in distributed environments
- Evaluating performance and learning is more difficult in remote settings (example with the mentorship model of the reporter / mimicking hard work)
- Remote / online does not always translate - fidelity of the experience is different
- How to approach learning: focus on learning experience/challenge (not grades), focus on teamwork (including team grading)

-> question: who would agree with the learning/challenge over grades?

18 min
- Excellence in teams: basketball vs. soccer (in basketball, the best player counts, in soccer, the worst players on the team count)
- Longevity, consistency, productivity
- Interdependency in interconnected worlds (the work of the team can be undone by individuals)
- Example: 1 million-dollar operation with a 5 $- shot forgotten: already killed the patient
