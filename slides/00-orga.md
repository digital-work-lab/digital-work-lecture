# Learning objectives

- Describe the historical, organizational, and societal drivers of change in digital work.
- Understand how digitalization changes work for individuals, teams, and crowds.
- Build you repertoire of practices, methods, and tools for effective digital work.
- Explain corresponding theories of personal information management, media synchronicity, and virtual teams.
- Appreciate different forms of scientific knowledge, theories, and methods prevalent in research on digital work.
- Critically evaluate ethical outcomes and recommend policy measures.

<!-- 
technology choice, effective (situational) use

- Familiarize with a repertoire of techniques, methods, and policies for effective digital work at the levels of individuals, teams, and crowds.
- Apply, adapt, and critically discuss these methods in different practical contexts.

critically discuss: understand where they come from/how they were developed (based on what evidence/theories)
Critically discuss ethical challenges associated with the future of work.

Modulkatalog:
Nach Abschluss des Kurses haben die Studierenden ein Verständnis über die Veränderungen, Gestaltungsbereiche und Auswirkungen digitaler Arbeit. Insbesondere können sie ein Repertoire ausgewählter Methoden, Designprinzipien und organisationelle Policies erklären und situativ anwenden. Zudem können sie die Evaluation einzelner Maßnahmen diskutieren und sie mit diesem Hintergrundwissen  effektiv und verantwortungsvoll in der Praxis einsetzen.

# How this lecture approaches digital work

<!-- The "philosophical foundations" -->

- Science and practice inform each other.
	- Scientists are not the only producers of knowledge in this field (unlike in medicine, for example).
	- It is valid to study how practitioners commonly work or how outstanding performers work, especially when there is limited scientific evidence. 
	- To do that, it is important to appreciate differences in scientific knowledge, including theories, methods, and evidence.

- We focus on **understanding** changes as well as underlying theory and evidence to shape digital work, and on **applying** repertoire of techniques and methods.

- The course is an opportunity to adapt, test, and refine the methods that work best for you.
