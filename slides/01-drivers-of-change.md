# Lecture 1: Drivers of change in digital work

---

<!-- _class: centered -->

To understand **changes in work**, we need to understand **changes in organizations**.

# The historical development of work

<!-- The economy and it's revolutions -->

The first industrial revolution (1760-1830)
- Key technological developments: steam power, iron making, manufacturing machinery
- Work transitions from hand production methods to industrial production work supported by machines
- Social and organizational changes:
  - Emergence of the factory system, industrial centers, and urbanization
  - Shift from task-based work to time-based work following the industrial rhythm

The second industrial revolution (1870-1914)
- Key technological developments: scientific discoveries (patents), standardization, mass production
- Work is shaped by Taylorist principles, later referred to as **scientific management**.
- Social and organizational changes:
  - Early labor laws and growth of labor unions (collective bargaining, measures against child labor)
  - Movement toward standardized workdays (8-hour days\*)

> * Note: The 5-day workweek was promoted in 1926 by Ford to improve productivity and give workers the opportunity to consume goods.

# Scientific management

Scientific management, or the Taylorist principles, are named after Frederick Taylor (1865-1915)

1. **Separate** the work of workers (efficient task completion) and managers (analysis, planning, training).
2. Use of the **scientific method** to study work and determine the most efficient way to perform specific tasks (instead of working based on common sense or rules of thumb).
3. **Match** workers to their jobs based on capability and train them to work at maximum efficiency (instead of hiring generalists with broad skill sets).
4. **Monitor** worker performance, and provide instructions to ensure that workers work in the most efficient way possible.

These principles continue to influence the organization of work today.

# From mass production to competitive strategies

- Mass production achieves high output and operational efficiency <br>(e.g., through Kanban\*).
- Several markets are saturated by mass production in the 20th century. Demand for innovative, high quality products and services grows.
- Organizations adopt new competitive strategies (Porter 1985):
	- Cost leadership strategy (e.g., involving automation technology, and efficiency measures like Lean or Sig Sigma)
	- Differentiation strategy (e.g., focus on quality or customer experience)
	- Focus strategy (e.g., focusing on customers with unique needs)

- Rising demand for highly skilled workers across industries

> * Note: Kanban boards can be found in modern software development tools and methods, including Scrum and Agile.

# Organizations

<!-- TBD: at one point, it may even be interesting to cover Institions (like banks, ... - trust and capital is important for work) -->

Organizations are a key innovation: As a legal entity, organizations acquire capital, organize work, and satisfy customer demands.

Different types of organizations often have different working cultures:

- Large industrial corporations
- Public companies (stocks owned by shareholders)
- Small-and-medium-sized enterprises (Germany)
- Startups
- Digital-native enterprises
- Freelancers

<!-- _class: centered -->

**Key question**: Can we expect to work in larger or smaller organizations in the future? How can we explain the size of an organization?

---

# Transaction cost theory

- Assumption: organizations can either organize work in institutional **hierarchies** or source it from the **market**.
- Organizational size is then influenced by the balance of internal and external transaction costs.
- Transaction costs include *search and information costs*, *bargaining and decision costs*, and *pricing and enforcement costs*.
- Transaction costs vary across industries and value chains. Information and communication technology (ICT) often decrease transaction costs.

# The digital revolution

<!-- TBD: The third industrial revolution/the digital revolution? -->

- A shift towards differentiation and services (third sector)
- Ground-braking technology innovations, such as the Internet, e-commerce, and digital platforms
- Growing bargaining power of highly skilled workers (*war for talent*)
- Disruptive changes in a highly connected world: dot-com boom, the 2007/8 financial crisis, COVID-19
- New challenges, such as algorithmic management, and marginalization

How the digital revolution changes the nature of work (examples):
- Shorter cycles for updating skills
- Shift towards remote work
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) augments or replaces jobs

---

# Knowledge work

- Many professions increasingly involve knowledge work, and innovation is becoming a key driver of progress across industries
- Examples of knowledge workers: consultants, programmers, researchers, lawyers, pilots, and doctors
- Many of these professions aim to implement research innovations, adopt evidence-based practices, document compliance, and improve continuously
- The term "knowledge economy" is coined to illustrate the the production of goods and services is dominated by knowledge-intensive activities

**Question**: How will the future of work look like?

# The future of work: A philosopher's view

Key question: How *should* we work in the future, especially when automation will (partially) replace jobs?

The *new work* paradigm (Frithjof Bergmann, 1984) envisions new ways of working in the digital age. It is based on the values of autonomy, freedom, and participation.

Three pillars of new work

- Gainful employment
- Smart consumption (self sufficiency)
- Calling (doing what you really, really *want*)

# The future of work: An economist's view

Raj Chetty (Harvard University) presents results from large-scale econometric analyses, using census data and data provided by Facebook (big data).

Findings:

- Upward mobility is declining: "90% of children born in 1940 grew up to earn more than their parents. Today, only half of all children earn more than their parents did." (Opportunity Insight)
- Implications for policy makers: Implement effective measures to reduce disparities (e.g., integrating disadvantaged people in small groups to interact with successful people).
- Suggestion: It is not a zero-sum game (all competing for a limited number of jobs), but a cake that can grow through entrepreneurship, and innovation.

# The future of work: A realist's view

![bg right:35% width:300px](../material/cal-newport.png)

Cal Newport (Professor, Georgetown University)

So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love (popular science book):

- Rule 1: Don't follow your passion.
- Rule 2: Be so good they can't ignore you.
- Rule 3: Turn down a promotion to take control.
- Rule 4: Think small, act big.

> üîó A recording of the talk is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIMu1PGbG-0).
