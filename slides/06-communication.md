# Lecture 6 - Digital work in teams

# Communication

---

<!-- _class: overview_part_3 -->

---

# Learning objectives: 

- Explain the selection of appropriate communication technologies based on media synchronicity theory
- Describe the role of situational awareness in communication settings
- Appreciate different facets and practical consideration related to communication in teams

---

# GitLab: work where you want, when you want

Read the case of Choudhury et al. (2020) and answer the following questions:

- What are the **main challenges** that need to be addressed in all-remote companies?
- What are the **key organizing principles** at GitLab?
- What are the **boundary conditions** for all-remote approaches?

---

# Communication and media selection

Key question: which communication media are the most effective ones, or should be selected for a task at hand?

**Media richness theory** (Daft and Lengel, 1986):

- Communication is essential in organizational information processing to reduce uncertainty and equivocality.
- Communication media differ in richness (video calls transmit richer information, e.g., including gestures).
- Richer communication media are generally more effective for communicating equivocal issues.

**Media synchronicity theory** (Dennis et al. 2008)
- There are different communication tasks:
    - *Conveyance* refers to the transmission of information.
    - *Convergence* refers to the process of mutually agreeing on the meaning of information.
- Communication media differ in their ability to support synchronicity, depending on their transmission or processing capabilities.
- Communiation performance, essentially, depends on the **fit** between communication processes, media synchronicity, and appropriation factors.

# MST: examples and application

1. Shared whiteboard in videoconferences: how does it change the media capabilities?
2. It was a misunderstanding, but one that escalated quickly. Why can asynchronous textual communication (such as email or chat) be problematic in such settings?
3. When sending out invitations to the weekly video-conference, your colleague emphasizes that he looks forward to **seeing** you in the call, and greets participants who share their video with a "nice to see you". Do you see any connections to MST?
4. Take a minute to review the features offered by the [Zoom AI assistant](https://www.zoom.com/en/products/collaboration-tools/features/). How do they relate to MST?
5. Consider a setting in which you would like to help your colleague with a challenging programming task. Your colleague works remotely. Which technologies would you select, and how could your choice be connected to MST?

# Communication and situational awareness

Endsley's cognitive model of **situational awareness** provides a useful framework to think about communication.

Situational awareness involves three levels:
- Perception of data and elements of the environment (communication partners)
- Comprehension of the meaning and significance of the situation (communication goals)
- Projection of future states and events (potential communication outcomes)

Decisions and actions (related to communication) create a feedback loop, affecting communication partners, and awareness of changing situations over time.

# Situational awareness: examples

Examples of situational awareness in practice:

- "At what times do you focus, at what times are you available for calls?"
- "Are you green?"
- "You have been quiet. What is your view on the issue?"

# Practice: Communication at GitLab

<!-- In small groups (2-3),  -->
Take a few minutes to examine the [communication section](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/) in GitLab's handbook and take notes on
- The different communication settings
- Best practices (potential challenges to keep in mind)

Major items to cover:
- [Effective and responsible communication guidelines](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#effective--responsible-communication-guidelines)
- [Internal communication best practices](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#top-tips-and-best-practices)
- [Video calls](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#video-calls) and [E-Mail](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#email)

Additional items (select the ones you are most interested in):
- [Slack](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#slack), [direct messages](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#avoid-direct-messages), [meeting problems](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#common-meeting-problems), or [video and presentation tips](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#video-and-presentation-tips-with-lorraine-lee)
