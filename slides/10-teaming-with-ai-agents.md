Note: bots vs. AI (technology is often hard to distinguish by users, may be a combination of rule-base, ML, reinforcement learning, LLM)
Approaches: RAG, Context
Handbook Example?!
TBD:
- start with algorithmic management (role of (anthropomorphous) bots? / uncanny valley)
- different forms of bots and capabilities (chatbot, ... )?
Shortcomings (statistical parrot, reasoning, ...)

## Application use cases and limitations

Practice
