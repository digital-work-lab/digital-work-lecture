2. Compensation (distributive justice, also involving diversity)
    - utilitarianim: superior performance may justify it (merit)
    - contract (employees relying on the contract)
    - (un)fair discourse (if some voices were not heard - especially employees who joined later)
    - virtue of a boss: treat/pay everyong at the same standards
    - communitarianism: diversity/gender (market mechanisms vs what society (should) value)

<h1 id="workplace-surveillance">Workplace surveillance</h1>
<p>Revisit the team, which has transitioned into remote work over the pandemic.</p>
<p>Indicate whether you agree whether the following steps are ok:</p>
<ul>
<li>The manager looks at the teams status to see who is working. is that ok?</li>
<li>He takes notes when someone is not available.</li>
<li>He writes a script to systematically monitor the times of availabiliy</li>
<li>He uses a new employee-insights feature that provides regular screenshots</li>
<li>He uses ML to analyze the screenshots and automatically sanctions/fires employees</li>
</ul>
<p>Twist: - performance is declining significantly - there overemployment</p>

<p>Ethics of surveillance: under which circumstances is surveillance ok, are there circumstances under which someone should never be under surveillance?</p>
<p>Bentham’s Panopticon: focus on prisons (utilitarian) George Orwell 1984 (Dystopie): extended to society (a feature of totalitarian regimes)</p>
<p>Surveillance poses a threat to privacy. 1890: Privacy as the “right to be let alone” (legal context, by Warren and Brandeis) privacy of the individual and security of the community may need to be balanced</p>
<p>Cause of surveillance matters: for security, for mutual benefit (loyalty cards/smart toll cards in transport), or for personal gains Consent is important (but may not always be considered necessary)</p>
<p>Today/In practice, justifications for surveillance often include both consequentialist and deontological considerations</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilitarian/consequentialists: Justification for large-scale surveillance: consequentialist appeal to the greater good. (everyone accepts a small inconvenience (privacy) but the company can redue moral hazard dynamics)</li>
<li>Deontologists: resist the justification for overriding the rights of the few by the interest of the many. Compelling justifications (judges) and limited scope would be required.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cambridge analytica (misusing massive Facebook data in the election) - surveillance is hidden (resembling totalitarian tendencies of Orwell)</p>

<li>Die Unterlagen sind noch nicht vergleichbar mit Kursen, die es schon Jahrelang gibt.</li>
<li>Und auch in den Sessions hat einiges gut funktioniert und andere Punkte werden im nächsten Jahr anders aussehen.</li>
<li>Es soll für Sie kein Nachteil sein, dass Sie die ersten Teilnehmenden in der Veranstaltung waren.</li>

<p>Erinnerung: Evaluation läuft.</p>
<p>Next session: - Probeklausur - Bonus - Schwerpunkt für die Wiederholungssession</p>
<p>Wiederholungssession - Ihre Inhalte</p>

knowledge workers (like famous athletes) excell in performance and are often paid vast amounts of money
-> is that fair?
-> who agrees?
-> those who don't agree: why?
-> what the market values is chance (not necessarily the merit of the athlete): e.g., football vs. ping-pong
-> the skill is only possible due to societies' investments in training/education -> call for pay-back
-> what's the role of equal opportunities (at the beginning)?
-> what's the role of values like inclusion and diversity? e.g., should female soccer players be paid equally?


Surveillance (privacy / people analytics software / overemployment) - 

- Algorithmic management : under what conditions would it be ethical (imagine Uber 2.0)
- People analytics / workforce intelligence
- Futures of digital work: ethics (algorithmic management, people analytics, )

- contract: employees don't honor their contract (work less) vs. societal contract (work: trust, don't be spied upon)
