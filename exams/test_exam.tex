\textbf{B (5 points)} State the five core processes of Getting-Things-Done.

\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{C (10 points)} Your colleagues at work are skeptical about Getting-Things-Done because it has not been tested scientifically. You agree with them, but you also remember that this method aligns with established principles from cognitive research. Select two principles and explain how they are implemented in Getting-Things-Done.
