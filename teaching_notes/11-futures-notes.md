# Video summary: Grant/Gladwell: Uncomfortable with the future

Note: the last part complements the technology-focused futures and focuses more on organizations/people. It relates to several topics we discussed earlier in the lecture (e.g., remote work, excellence individually and in teams, development of skills)

- Lack of diversity in leadership and company culture's comfort focus hinders diversity and risk-taking.
- Embracing discomfort is crucial for fostering diversity and innovation.
- Encouraging questioning and learning helps challenge the status quo and drive growth.
- Focusing on learning experiences and teamwork over grades fosters better outcomes.
- Team success relies on collective performance, emphasizing interdependency and consistency.

Start

- Lack of diversity (in leadership) still an issue
- Persistent company culture: desire of those in charge to be comfortable.
- Need to embrace the feeling of uncomfortable. Related to diversity and risk.
(Need to be aware that a "comfort-culture" may not contribute to diversity.)

6 minutes

- How to encourage learning (questioning how things are done)
- Cost of uncomfortable: perception of friction
- Who benefits? (do we allow all uncomfortableness into our work? - destructive leadership)

10 minutes

- Encouraging disagreements/challenging thoughts in teams
- Coworkers who criticize can be the "canaries in the coalmine" or an "irritant"

11:20 minutes

- Future of leadership in distributed environments
- Evaluating performance and learning is more difficult in remote settings (example with the mentorship model of the reporter / mimicking hard work)
- Remote / online does not always translate - fidelity of the experience is different
- How to approach learning: focus on learning experience/challenge (not grades), focus on teamwork (including team grading)

-> question: who would agree with the learning/challenge over grades?

18 min

- Excellence in teams: basketball vs. soccer (in basketball, the best player counts, in soccer, the worst players on the team count)
- Longevity, consistency, productivity
- Interdependency in interconnected worlds (the work of the team can be undone by individuals)
- Example: 1 million-dollar operation with a 5 $- shot forgotten: already killed the patient
