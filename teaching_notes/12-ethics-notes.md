# Fair compensation

- Ask students what they expect as a starting salary (e.g., 70.000 €)
- Scenario: an employee (Olaf) makes 160 €.
- Is that fair? Who agrees/disagrees? Why?

    - Merit
    - Contract
    - If the other team members earn a decent / living wage

- Merit: who disagrees? (Sandell: fiction of merit: backdoors, e.g., university admission, ..., role of chance)

- How would you maximize utility?
- economic utility (performance and returns that will be spread among the team): 
- happiness: maybe distribute compensation more fairly.

- Contract: should it matter whether he/she has bought a house?

- Would you agree that the excessive compensation results from fair conditions? If the employer had to hire under pressure? If today's team members were not part of the discussion?

- What are the employers duties? Pay salaries stated in the contract.

- Should women soccer players receive the same compensation / bonus as men? (equal pay)

If necessary:

- Give a hypothetical example of standardized skill tests showing that the team members perform on par

<!-- 
2. Compensation (distributive justice, also involving diversity)
    - utilitarianim: superior performance may justify it (merit)
    - contract (employees relying on the contract)
    - (un)fair discourse (if some voices were not heard - especially employees who joined later)
    - virtue of a boss: treat/pay everyong at the same standards
    - communitarianism: diversity/gender (market mechanisms vs what society (should) value)

# Workplace surveillance

Revisit the team, which has transitioned into remote work over the pandemic.

Indicate whether you agree whether the following steps are ok:

- The manager looks at the teams status to see who is working. is that ok?
- He takes notes when someone is not available.
- He writes a script to systematically monitor the times of availabiliy
- He uses a new employee-insights feature that provides regular screenshots
- He uses ML to analyze the screenshots and automatically sanctions/fires employees

Twist: 
- performance is declining significantly
- there overemployment

Ethics of surveillance: under which circumstances is surveillance ok, are there circumstances under which someone should never be under surveillance?

Bentham's Panopticon: focus on prisons (utilitarian)
George Orwell 1984 (Dystopie): extended to society (a feature of totalitarian regimes)


Surveillance poses a threat to privacy.
1890: Privacy as the "right to be let alone" (legal context, by Warren and Brandeis)
privacy of the individual and security of the community may need to be balanced

Cause of surveillance matters: for security, for mutual benefit (loyalty cards/smart toll cards in transport), or for personal gains 
Consent is important (but may not always be considered necessary)

Today/In practice, justifications for surveillance often include both consequentialist and deontological considerations

- Utilitarian/consequentialists: Justification for large-scale surveillance: consequentialist appeal to the greater good. (everyone accepts a small inconvenience (privacy) but the company can redue moral hazard dynamics)
- Deontologists: resist the justification for overriding the rights of the few by the interest of the many. Compelling justifications (judges) and limited scope would be required.

Cambridge analytica (misusing massive Facebook data in the election)
- surveillance is hidden (resembling totalitarian tendencies of Orwell)


# Summary

- Die Veranstaltung ist komplett neu entstanden.
- Die Unterlagen sind noch nicht vergleichbar mit Kursen, die es schon Jahrelang gibt.
- Und auch in den Sessions hat einiges gut funktioniert und andere Punkte werden im nächsten Jahr anders aussehen.
- Es soll für Sie kein Nachteil sein, dass Sie die ersten Teilnehmenden in der Veranstaltung waren.
- 

Erinnerung: Evaluation läuft.

Next session:
- Probeklausur
- Bonus
- Schwerpunkt für die Wiederholungssession

knowledge workers (like famous athletes) excell in performance and are often paid vast amounts of money
-> is that fair?
-> who agrees?
-> those who don't agree: why?
-> what the market values is chance (not necessarily the merit of the athlete): e.g., football vs. ping-pong
-> the skill is only possible due to societies' investments in training/education -> call for pay-back
-> what's the role of equal opportunities (at the beginning)?
-> what's the role of values like inclusion and diversity? e.g., should female soccer players be paid equally?


Surveillance (privacy / people analytics software / overemployment) - 

- Algorithmic management : under what conditions would it be ethical (imagine Uber 2.0)
- People analytics / workforce intelligence
- Futures of digital work: ethics (algorithmic management, people analytics, )

- contract: employees don't honor their contract (work less) vs. societal contract (work: trust, don't be spied upon)
