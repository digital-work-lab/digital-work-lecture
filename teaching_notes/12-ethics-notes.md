# Fair compensation

- Ask students what they expect as a starting salary (e.g., 70.000 €)
- Scenario: an employee (Linda) makes 160 €.
- Is that fair? Who agrees/disagrees? Why?

    - Merit
    - Contract
    - If the other team members earn a decent / living wage

- **Merit**: who disagrees? (Sandell: **fiction of merit**: backdoors, e.g., university admission, ..., role of chance)

- Utility is an important concept - How would you maximize **utility**?
- economic utility (performance and returns that will be spread among the team): 
- happiness: maybe distribute compensation more fairly.

- Contract: should it matter whether he/she has bought a house?

- Would you agree that the excessive compensation results from fair conditions? If the employer had to hire under pressure? If today's team members were not part of the discussion?

- What are the employers duties? Pay salaries stated in the contract.

- Should women soccer players receive the same compensation / bonus as men? (equal pay)

If necessary:

- Give a hypothetical example of standardized skill tests showing that the team members perform on par

<!-- 
2. Compensation (distributive justice, also involving diversity)
    - utilitarianim: superior performance may justify it (merit)
    - contract (employees relying on the contract)
    - (un)fair discourse (if some voices were not heard - especially employees who joined later)
    - virtue of a boss: treat/pay everyong at the same standards
    - communitarianism: diversity/gender (market mechanisms vs what society (should) value)
-->

# Utilitarianism

cost-benefit:

- Classical example: Gladiator games
- Common in ethics of autonomous/self-driving vehicles

# Deontology

- Medical context: mandatory vaccination (or ventilators during covid)

Example of bad intentions accidentally leading to good consequences

- Manipulating Task Ratings (using fake accounts to increase one's own rating and rate others poorly) with the goal of gaining a (monetary) advantage
- By chance: same worker contributes to classifying a public health dataset, which leads to a breakthrough in understanding a public health issue, potentially saving lives and improving health outcomes for many people.

Analysis:

- Deontological Perspective: The worker's initial actions of manipulating ratings and undermining competitors are considered morally wrong because they involve deceit and unfair practices.
- Consequences: The positive outcome is the high-quality work on a critical task that leads to significant public health benefits. In this scenario, the worker's unethical behavior of manipulating the crowdsourcing system (bad intentions) results in a situation where their skills can be applied to produce a highly beneficial outcome (good consequences). From a deontological standpoint, the emphasis would remain on the immoral nature of the worker's actions rather than the beneficial result. This example underscores the ethical dilemmas that can arise in crowdwork, where the morality of actions is distinct from their outcomes.


# Virtue ethics

Leading with Integrity in a Virtual Team (even under pressure)

<!-- 
Situation:
A project manager, Alex, is leading a diverse, remote team working on a high-stakes software development project. The deadline is tight, and the team faces numerous challenges, including technical difficulties and differing time zones.

Virtuous Behavior:

Honesty: Alex is transparent with the team about the project's challenges and the tight deadlines. He communicates openly about the issues and avoids sugarcoating the situation, fostering a culture of trust.
Integrity: Despite the pressure to deliver on time, Alex refuses to cut corners or compromise on quality. He insists on adhering to best practices and ethical standards, even if it means working longer hours or negotiating for deadline extensions.
Compassion: Alex recognizes the stress and workload his team is under. He regularly checks in with team members, offering support and encouragement. He acknowledges their hard work and makes efforts to accommodate personal circumstances, such as flexible working hours to balance family commitments.
Justice: Alex ensures that credit is given where it's due, recognizing the contributions of each team member in meetings and reports. He also distributes tasks fairly, taking into account each team member's strengths and workloads.
Patience: Alex remains calm and patient, especially when dealing with setbacks or when team members need extra time to resolve issues. His patience helps maintain a positive and productive work environment.
Consequences:

Increased Team Morale: Alex's virtuous leadership boosts team morale and fosters a strong sense of loyalty and commitment among team members.
High-Quality Work: The team's adherence to ethical standards and best practices results in a high-quality product, even if it takes a bit longer to complete.
Trust and Respect: The team develops a deep trust and respect for Alex, enhancing long-term collaboration and success in future projects.
Virtue Ethics Perspective:
Focus on Character: Alex's behavior is guided by virtues such as honesty, integrity, compassion, justice, and patience, reflecting his character and ethical principles.
Moral Development: By leading with these virtues, Alex not only helps the team succeed in the project but also contributes to the moral development of his team members, encouraging them to embody similar virtues in their work.

# Workplace surveillance

Revisit the team, which has transitioned into remote work over the pandemic.

Indicate whether you agree whether the following steps are ok:

- The manager looks at the teams status to see who is working. is that ok?
- He takes notes when someone is not available.
- He writes a script to systematically monitor the times of availabiliy
- He uses a new employee-insights feature that provides regular screenshots
- He uses ML to analyze the screenshots and automatically sanctions/fires employees

Twist: 
- performance is declining significantly
- overemployment

<!-- https://iep.utm.edu/surv-eth/ -->

Ethics of surveillance: under which circumstances is surveillance ok, are there circumstances under which someone should never be under surveillance?

Bentham's Panopticon: focus on prisons (utilitarian)
George Orwell 1984 (Dystopie): extended to society (a feature of totalitarian regimes)


Surveillance poses a threat to privacy.
1890: Privacy as the "right to be let alone" (legal context, by Warren and Brandeis)
privacy of the individual and security of the community may need to be balanced

Cause of surveillance matters: for security, for mutual benefit (loyalty cards/smart toll cards in transport), or for personal gains 
Consent is important (but may not always be considered necessary)

Today/In practice, justifications for surveillance often include both consequentialist and deontological considerations

- Utilitarian/consequentialists: Justification for large-scale surveillance: consequentialist appeal to the greater good. (everyone accepts a small inconvenience (privacy) but the company can redue moral hazard dynamics)
- Deontologists: resist the justification for overriding the rights of the few by the interest of the many. Compelling justifications (judges) and limited scope would be required.

Cambridge analytica (misusing massive Facebook data in the election)
- surveillance is hidden (resembling totalitarian tendencies of Orwell)

# Platforms and crowd-worker exploitation

- overall utility: honest or even hard feedback can have positive effects (for clients and workers). If a few workers fail, the overall utility may still be positive.
- duty to fulfill contracts/terms-of-service? duty as an employer?

# Summary

- cases: thinking in scenarios (testing whether our justification holds even in extreme cases)
- focus on individual liberty (negative/positive liberty)
- communitarian approaches: civic goods (like open software) can be corrupted when introducing market mechanisms (e.g., )

- Circumstances matter:

    - It matters how decisions are implemented
    - Intentions and communication matter
    - The act itself can affect the actors/resources

# Outlook

- Die Veranstaltung ist komplett neu entstanden.
- Die Unterlagen sind noch nicht vergleichbar mit Kursen, die es schon Jahrelang gibt.
- Und auch in den Sessions hat einiges gut funktioniert und andere Punkte werden im nächsten Jahr anders aussehen.
- Es soll für Sie kein Nachteil sein, dass Sie die ersten Teilnehmenden in der Veranstaltung waren.

Summary:
- hist.+org. Entwicklung
- Skill classifications, GTD (with cognitive principles)
- PIME and second-brain appraoches
- Excellence: theory of embodied cognition + Influences
- Remote work: effects, role of trust and conflict, Gitlab examples
- Communication: MST, model of situational awareness
- Git: manipulating branch trees and areas
- OpenSource work principles (Raymond) + collaboration game (control and coordination in operations)
- Entrepreneurial work: contexts and procedures (power of platform owners)
- Sourcing knowledge intensive services: boundaries, challenges, process
- Futures of work summaries + substitution and disaggregation
- Ethics: examples and theories

Erinnerung: Evaluation läuft.

Next session:
- Probeklausur
- Fragen / Schwerpunkt für die Wiederholungssession (Ihre Inhalte)


<!-- 

knowledge workers (like famous athletes) excell in performance and are often paid vast amounts of money
-> is that fair?
-> who agrees?
-> those who don't agree: why?
-> what the market values is chance (not necessarily the merit of the athlete): e.g., football vs. ping-pong
-> the skill is only possible due to societies' investments in training/education -> call for pay-back
-> what's the role of equal opportunities (at the beginning)?
-> what's the role of values like inclusion and diversity? e.g., should female soccer players be paid equally?


Surveillance (privacy / people analytics software / overemployment) - 

- Algorithmic management : under what conditions would it be ethical (imagine Uber 2.0)
- People analytics / workforce intelligence
- Futures of digital work: ethics (algorithmic management, people analytics, )

- contract: employees don't honor their contract (work less) vs. societal contract (work: trust, don't be spied upon)
