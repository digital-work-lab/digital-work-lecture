# Lecture 5 - Digital work in teams

# Remote teams

<!--
Remote becomes a challenge when we work in teams (more than working individually)

Back-and-forth: e.g., Twitter: calling employees back to the offices

# Learning objectives

- Explore GitLab's approach as a remote-first organization and familiarize with its handbook.
- Appreciate the challenges and opportunities in settings where teams are highly dispersed.

<!-- 
digital newbie firms > digital-first firms > remote-first firms
geographically dispersed...

# The case of GitLab

- GitLab: An open-source company that operates GitLab, a DevOps platform for software development
- A public all-remote company with no physical offices
- 2,100 employees across 60 countries
- Outreach and education efforts, such as the [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/remote-team-management) or the [remote playbook](https://about.GitLab.com/company/culture/all-remote/) 
- An exciting case to understand how all-remote models can work

[Interview with Sid Sijbrandij, co-founder and CEO of GitLab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0dRWDmYSvg)

Tips for a productive all-remote workforce [u0dRWDmYSvg].webm

Discuss the video: key elements for the transition?
- senior leadership must go all-remote (people mimic thatt)
- transparency: fewer informal communication channels
- making decisions asynchronously (DRI: directly resonsible individual who may solicit feedback but makes the decision - combining the advantages of a consensus  and a hierarchical culture)
- iterative approach to avoid coordination problems (software development approach)
- handbook first (code company norms, processes etc. - don't "document" ex post)

How does the DRI (everyone can make decisions) work?  (hiring selection,  builds trust - transparency prevents exploitation of trust)

- flexibility for workers, for hiring (across geographies)
- challenges of asynchronous work
- handbook

# The Remote playbook

Take a look at the following sections of the  [playbook](https://about.GitLab.com/company/culture/all-remote/) :

- Different remote models
- Transition to remote
- Leadership in remote teams
- Mental health

<!--
Remote models: add covid-home-office, FTS, digital nomads

Leadership: trust/control/conflict
-> DRI: directly responsible individual

Note. skip communication

forms of remote-work arrangements: (+ digital nomads? / time-zones, ...)

- Would you like to work in an all-remote company?

QUESTION/BLACKBOARD:
- What are the key challenges / benefits of remote work?

# Common challenges in remote work

- Managing work-life boundaries (e.g., unplugging after work, working longer hours)
- Team-related (e.g., communication, different time zones, cultural differences)
- Self-management (e.g., time management, technical problems, career development)
- Mental and physical side-effects (e.g., isolation, lack of connection, sedentary lifestyle)

	boundaries: distractions
	Key challenges: find surveys (1/3 feel disconnected from colleagues)
	https://timeular.com/blog/challenges-working-remotely/
- Work-life boundary management/expectations: availability (time, channels): better to set generally (asking for ok), rather than pushing back specific requests

# Benefits of remote work

- Flexibility and autonomy
- Less commuting time
- Better work-life balance
- Higher productivity and motivation
- Reduced turnover
- Lower costs for office space

importance of retention: cost of replacing an employer: 6-9  x their last monthly salary

# Evidence at the individual level (II)

Meta-analysis by Gajendran and Harrison (2007):
- Small but beneficial effects on proximal outcomes (e.g., perceived autonomy and (lower) work-family conflict)
- No generally negative effects on quality of workplace relationships
- Beneficial effects on distal outcomes (e.g., job satisfaction, performance, turnover intention, role stress)
- High-intensity telecommuting (> 2.5 days/week) is beneficial for (reduced) work-family conflict, but harms relationships with coworkers

# The GitLab handbook

- The handbook is a key element at GitLab 
- It has over 2,000 pages and everyone can suggest changes

1. Go to the [handbook](https://about.GitLab.com/handbook/) and gain an overview of what is covered
2. Imagine you were to join GitLab. Navigate to the onboarding page and review the onboarding issue template. What are the key things you are expected to do in the first days?
3. Briefly review the strategy document.
4. Scan the values section. Is there anything surprising, or something you (dis)agree with?

<!--
Employee handbook: transparency of processes, values, practices

Go for perfect harmony (STUDENTS?)
- giving feedback (Kindness/caring)
- safety (e.g., when the company is struggling/laying off people)
- Inclusion: e.g., have everyone heard at meetings
- support (pair programming, skills)


Handbook: disfunctions
- Conflict: can it be beneficial?
- Challenging: a little bit of task-conflict is important to find good solutions, it may also be necessary to settle relationship conflicts (storming phase)
- BUT: escalating conflict may also get you fired
- team phases: forming, storming, norming, performing
- Diverse teams often outperform homogenous teams (reinforcing groupthink)


Trust: important in teams - why?

Control and delegation
- input (hiring), clan (informal)
- different modes of delegation (DRI)
- "who has the monkey"?, who is empowered, makes decisions and drives change?

Handbook: trust is an outcome - earned not given.
-> how could trust be managed? -> selection: hiring/firing, company norms

explain dogfooding

day 5: add yourself to the team page

culture: reflected in the handbook=
- documentation / self learning
- helping: updating docs
- team: connecting

Open-source organizing principles
TBD: which aspects should not be disclosed publicly?
[[Team conflict]] / [[KankanhalliTanWei2006]]
- Cover control (formal, clan, ... ) + Wiener 2019?

# The role of trust for effective virtual teams

Meta-analysis by Breuer et al. (2016):

![width:500px center](../material/BreuerEtAl2016.png)


<!--
Higher virtuality increases the effect of trust on team effectiveness (through higher perceived risk)
Documentation should decrease the effect of trust on team effectiveness  (through lower perceived risk)

# Homework

Read the paper of Choudhury et al. (2020), who presents the perspectives of different organizational scientists on GitLab's all-remote approach. Take notes to answer the following questions:
- What are the **main challenges** that need to be addressed in all-remote companies?
- What are the **key organizing principles** at GitLab?
- What are the **boundary conditions** for all-remote approaches?
