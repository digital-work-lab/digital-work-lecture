# Lecture 10 - Digital work in crowds

# Digital markets for knowledge-intensive services

<!-- Sourcing digital work from platforms -->

---

<!-- _class: overview_part_4 -->

---

# Learning objectives

- Familiarize with the scientific discourse on sourcing knowledge-intensive services from platform markets.
- Outline different ways in which literature review methods can contribute to scientific progress.

<!-- 
Emphasize: for-profit crowd work
Focus on crowd-work platforms (knowledge work - sourcing knowledge work is a particular challenge)
-->

# Digital markets for knowledge-intensive services

Platforms: Upwork, Toptal, Topcoder

Examples of tasks: Programming, design, app development, data science, customer services, translation, and digital marketing.

![bg right:35% width:400px](../material/Snir2003-fig3.png)

Economic potential:

- 72 million jobs by 2025 (Manyika et al. 2015)
- Effects of reducing restrictions on emigration: Trillion-dollar bills on the sidewalk? (Clemens, 2011)

<!-- - Illustrate basic modalities: parties, projects, contract types etc. and key challenges: trust, pricing, quality/requirements, arbitration ... (agency theory (moral hazard), incentives and monitoring) -->

# Literature searches

Search techniques: Database searches, citation searches, table-of-content searches

Concept groups as the typical query structure in database searches:

- (Synonym_1 OR Synonym_2 OR ...) AND (Synonym_10 OR Synonym_11 OR ...) ...
- Example (health sciences): Population AND Intervention AND Control AND Outcome (PICO)
- Use of controlled vocabulary (e.g., the [Medical Subject Headings, MeSH](https://meshb-prev.nlm.nih.gov/treeView))

# Challenges in the search

In the social sciences (including the Management and Organizational disciplines, as well as Information Systems), there is *no controlled vocabulary*, and researchers may try to introduce new terms.

Examples of terms used for our context:

- online labor markets, digital labor markets,
- microsourcing, online outsourcing,
- macro-tasks, human computing, skilled labor,
- online freelancing, IT service work, gig work.

Note : Example based on Wagner, Prester, Paré (2021)

# Effective searches with heterogeneous terminology

Initial guidelines:

1. Name the challenge of uncontrolled vocabulary to raise awareness
2. Rely on search techniques that are robust to heterogeneous terminology, including citation searches, tables-of-contents searches
3. Systematically collect prior knowledge, including keywords used in prior literature reviews, and consult with colleagues
4. Complete several search iterations and look for new search terms
5. Use evidence from previous iterations to identify relevant keywords and construct queries

<!-- 
Note: focus on phenomena

5.: currently under development

Similar: "future of work" / "new work" / "non-standard careers"

illustrate how the search design would be done in the health sciences
- illustrate terminologcial variety
- emphasize the need to iterate (for methodological improvement)
- no "one-shot" literature review
-->

# Screening

The screening process is often split into two stages:

- A prescreen, which is based on meta data (titles and abstracts) and tends to be more inclusive
- A screen, which is based on full-text documents and tends to be more restrictive

The screen often involves specific inclusion and exclusion criteria.

**How would you screen if there is no established definition for our phenomenon (digital platforms for knowledge-intensive services)?**

# Exercise

- Form groups of 3 students.
- Read through the extracts of process steps, sequences, and models.
- Develop a process model to summarize prior research.

# Contracting decisions

- Contracting rates are low, especially for high-volume projects.
- Some antecedents (explaining variables) are contested. For example, some expect ratings to be the most important variable, while others disagree because ratings have minimal variance.
- Literature reviews can provide an overview of the evidence across prior studies.

<!-- 
Next: which factors lead to contracts (actual work)? 
- remember the low contracting rates at the beginning
- low variance in ratings (Kokkodis)
-->
---

# Prior research on contracting decisions

We identified approx. 20 studies providing empirical evidence on contracting decisions

Challenge: Every empirical study has errors (Card, 2015, Lin et al. 2013):

- Sampling error (random selection from the population)
- Measurement error (random error and systematic errors caused by measurement instruments)
- Inflated p-values (large samples have excessive test power and detect negligible effects)

In addition, research with non-significant findings rarely gets published, leading to publication bias (the file-drawer problem).

<!-- 
TODO :
-  illustrate publication bias with a forest plot
- illustrate test power with gaussian curves (low test power: flat curve that ovarlaps zero, high test power: spiky curve that does not cut zero)
-->

---

# Literature reviews: Aggregating evidence

Specific types of literature reviews, aimed at theory testing, can be used to aggregate the empirical evidence. These include (qualitative) systematic reviews, vote-counting studies, and meta-analyses.

They rely on rigorous methods, including

- Comprehensive searches (including unpublished research)
- Systematic screening (conducted in parallel independent mode and based on explicit criteria)
- Quality appraisal (to identify risk of bias)
- Data extraction (conducted in parallel independent mode and based on a predefined data extraction schema)
- Meta-analytic regressions (or vote-counting)

Taken together, these steps can (partially) address the shortcomings of empirical studies.

# Model for selection decisions (preliminary)

![width:750px center](../material/PresterWagner2021-fig3.png)

Prester and Wagner (2021)

---

# Principal findings

Workers are more likely to receive contracts when:

- the price is lower
- they have earned a badge (platform certification)
- they have a prior working relationship with the client
- they are located in the same country
f
It is important to recognize that despite many studies (and many significant findings), very few antecedents have a substantial effect.

---

# Conclusion

- Digital platforms for knowledge-intensive services: Boundary conditions, process, and model of contracting decisions.
- Literature review contributions: Synthesizing prior work across heterogeneous terminology and seemingly incompatible process descriptions. Aggregating evidence to overcome the shortcomings of individual empirical studies.


<!-- - Role of the platform provider (Gol / central vs decentral) 

- Drivers: Why would you work on platforms when you could have a job at a traditional company? (singal skills, simple entry, no geographical restrictions - paper: Trillion-dollar bills on the sidewalk) - also: interesting to study (working purely remote, working with many clients/switching jobs often), it enables hyper-specialization (particular skill with 40h demand globally: you can make a job with it)

- Trust mechanisms (rating systems, ...),  Kokkodis: non-transferability, rating inflation, contracting rates

- Best practices (TBD )
