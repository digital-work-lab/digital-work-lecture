- after each episode: summarize on the blackboard
- no AI, but societal/work questions


Start
- Lack of diversity (in leadership) still an issue (company culture contributes to this persistent issue: desire of those in charge to be comfortable. Need to embrace the feeling of uncomfortable. Related to diversity and risk. Need to be aware that a "comfort-culture" may not contribute to diversity.)

6 minutes
- How to encourage learning (questioning how things are done)
- Cost of uncomfortable: perception of friction (for whose benefit do we allow uncomfortableness into our work? - destructive leadership)

10 minutes
- encouraging disagreements/challenging thoughts in teams (coworkers who criticize can be the "canaries in the coalmine" or an "irritant")

11:20 minutes
- future of leadership in distributed environments
- evaluating performance and learning is more difficult in remote settings (example with the mentorship model of the reporter / mimicking hard work)
- remote / online does not always translate - fidelity of the experience is different
- skill development and networking: more focus/distinction after the covid experiment
- learning / how to approach education: focus on learning experience/challenge (not grades), focus on teamwork (team based grades / evaluation)

18 min
- excellence in teams: in basketball, the best player counts, in soccer, the worst players on the team count
- Soccer-type excellence will dominate. (Paul Simon: 30 albums vs Rolling Stones: 4 albums)
- longevity, consistency, productivity
- interdependency in interconnected worlds (the work of the team can be undone by individuals)
- example: 1 million-dollar operation with a 5 $- shot forgotten: already killed the patient

24 min.

-> question: who would agree with the learning/challenge over grades?
