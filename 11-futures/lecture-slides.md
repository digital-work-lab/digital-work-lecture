# Lecture 11 - Digital work and its futures

# Humans vs Machines

---

<!-- _class: overview_part_5 -->

---

Learning objectives: 

- Predict whether they will be replacement of human labor by machines in the near future (using illustrative examples).
- Discuss possible futures at the intersection of AI-based and human work.

---

TODO 

- Start the discussion: What are the key challenges in the future of work?

<!-- 
Simon Sinek: there's a lot in the air right now / nobody knows exactly where it will land
- example: remote work (people telling their managers that they've moved to Florida / Twitter calling back employees)

- Use videos to illustrate trends / get experts assessments

nice AI/automation/robotics examples (6 years old but interesting)

# Substitution of labor

- IAB Substituierbarkeitspotentiale.pdf
-> give examples

part of the equation could be customer self-service

# Non-substitutable skills

- Communication
- Context
- Emotional competence
- Teaching
- Connections
- An ethical compass

TODO : Analyze the paper and link it
-> TBD: discuss (e.g., teaching: MOOC?)

# Possible futures at the intersection of AI-based and human work

Possible futures of AI job replacement


---

# Future 1

- When most jobs have become automated..
- Human interaction will become the premium alternative
- Customers want to pay extra for having contact with a human representative
- Both AI and people will be employed at the same time for the same job

---

# Future 2

- Humans and machines have a complementary division of labor
- Computers will not be able to fully replicate human emotions
- Machines will carry out the repetitive tasks
- Humans would be supported by AI systems and become even more powerful

<!-- 
(uncanny valley)
-->
---

# Future 3

- A human-centric view of AI
- People retain full control over AI development
- Machines will be allowed to take over those industries, jobs or tasks that no human wants to engage with
- People can choose to work in those jobs that give them a sense of satisfaction or fulfillment
- All work will be done by machines

---

# Future 4

- A physical and cognitive integration of humans and machines
- People will be able to have body and mind enhancement
- Elon Musk: "A merger between biological and digital intelligence"
- The Neuralink project

---

# Future 5

- Machines completely dominate over humans
- Ray Kurzwall, Sam Harris
- Power of interconnected AI systems
- Imperfection of human behavior
- Gordon Briggs and Matthias Scheutz:  The case for robot disobedience
-Humans make mistakes in creating or mastering robots
- AI forms that are more complex than the software that produce them

ChatGPT:
- used as a coding co-pilot 
- Banned on UNSW campus
- example task for students: find the sources that led to a ChatGPT response
- potential pitfall: ChatGPT content is copyright licensed
- Blair Wang: potential way of addressing ChatGPT: include figures/diagrams (ChatGPT cannot do that yet), or require reflection related to the team

Comparison: Humans vs. machines

[[JainPadmanabhanPavlouEtAl2018]]: ... the main intellectual advances will be made by men and computers working together in intimate association. (Licklider 1960)

Machines outperform humans in (most traditional economic measures)
- reliability (errors)
- cost of operation (think: production of intangible artefacts: cost of copying/... is close to zero)
- mechanical precision (surgeons)
- computational power
Humans outperform machines (more important when "basic needs" are met / Maslow?)
- compassion
- fairness
- democracy
- fulfillment
