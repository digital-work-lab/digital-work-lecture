# Orga

Introduce myself:
- Regensburg (running)
- Montreal
- CV: not straigt-forward/planned

Teaching: when I teach, I teach - you have my attention.

## Warm-up question

Die Vorlesung mit Leben füllen, Ihre Ideen mit einbringen

- Studiengänge?
- Semester?
- Wer plant den Master zu machen?
- Jemand, der nicht in Bamberg bleiben möchte?
- Wer schon im Auslandssemester/Wo?
- Wer schon ein Praktikum?
- Wer hat ein klares Berufsziel?
- Was interessiert Sie an Digital Work, was würden Sie gerne lernen?

## Contents

What the couse does not cover...

How the lecture approaches digital work...

<!-- 

- The focus is on understanding the options that are available, know their inner workings (steps, principles), know under which circumstances they may or may not work (why), identify abstract concepts from specific technology examples. 

Wenn sich Ihr Arzt ein neues Heilverfahren ausdenkt und ausprobiert dann wird er die Tätigkeit so nicht lange ausüben. Nur wissenschaftlich erprobtes ist zugelassen.
Wenn sich ein Unternehmen überlegt, eine agile Arbeitsmethode einzusetzen, dann ist das nicht nur in Ordnung, sondern auch gewollt. 
Wir reden hier also über fundamental unterschiedliche Disziplinen der Wissenschaft.

IS: interdisciplinary, diverse: need to consider alternative views (theories)

Digital work is relatively new as a teaching topic (no established textbook, not everything is "scientifically proven" -> need to understand the evidence)

appreciate the scientific origins (theory, method, evidence)

not everyone will use the same system

-> also: policies (society/team/organiazation)

Learning: self-directed (additional resources), slides need to be complemented with notes (examples, ...)

## Grades and summaries

# Teaching notes: Drivers of change

## Warm-up: Reflection on the photo

What do see in the picture?

- Same building (previously a factory, today a coworking space)
- Major differences in worker protection: if a worker was injured 200 years ago, he was fired. If a worker is injured today, the manager may be fired.
- The modern office almost looks like a church, focus on empowerment and well-being of workers
- There are no production facilities, but books and digital devices (focus on knowledge work)

## Historical development

- Darstellung stark verkürzt. Ich lasse hier viel weg - was uns interessiert sind die großen Linien.
- Wichtig: Viele große Organisationen und Managementprinzipien gehen auf bis in die Zeit zurück.
- Rationalisierung/Effizienz
- Focus: mass markets and standardization, large organizations, low bargaining power of employees, low skill requirements (for most workers)
- Logic: push-to-market
- Massive gains in productivity (chart?), frees up human labor

<!--
Not covered: Peter Drucker etc.
-->

## Taylorist principles

- principles: have been criticized widely
- influence: how organizations structure work, hierarchies , how we think about work
- departemnt structures: division of labor
- HR/hiring: selection of the best workers based on objective figures (such as years of experience) - maybe also influenced by unions
- outcome-based compensation, 360 feedback -> objective selection/training
- Context: low skill requirements/workers can be replaced quickly


## Competitive strategies move beyond mass production

Lean/kanban: 
- making information flow transparent in the factory (coordination)
- stop the line, all workers focus on solving the problem (all are involved, have to think beyond their individual areas)

Focus: can be a cost or differentiation focus

Ausdifferenzierung

Skills: industrial (production/automotive, chemical, ...)

Porter, M. E. _[The Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/product/193)_. NY: Free Press, 1985. (Republished with a new introduction, 1998.)

TBD: Maybe as a back-up slide?

# Digitalization and the "flat world"

TODO : summarize key arguments of Friedman and ghemawat

Digitalization as a key driver
- "Flat-world hypothesis" vs. Ghemawat (scientific discourse as simple competing hypotheses) [[Hong2017a]]
 -->

## Organizations

Can you think of examples?
-> e.g., how they deal with innovation

Discuss how each organization would develop/introduce a website

Still simplifying... but we could imagine that:

- large industrial corporation: No website for 200 years, then the marketing department has hired programmers who are in charge of the website (since 20 years)
- Public companies: public-relations with shareholders and investors are critical, all communication is controlled
- SME: B2B, no need for a website... - hard to change established approaches
- Startups/DNE/Freelancers: online as the first step. 
- Startups: investing to grow/scale, reach new customers, offer products/services
- DNE: Data/Web is their business. detailed analytics/optimization (clickthrough, etc.)
- Freelancers: using platform services, making quick adption decisions (if needed - see pandemic)

## Transaction cost theory

TODO:

<!-- 

Example: Getränkehandel - Lieferservice intern oder extern? - 

Also a question of regulation/anti-trust laws/avoiding monopolies.

Capital: Haftung/liability

große Organisationen: Siemens, General Motors, General Electric Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo...
-> Rahmenbedingungen für (digitale) Arbeit und Frage: warum arbeiten wir in kleinen Startups bzw. großen Unternehmen und wovon hängt die Größe ab, wie verändert sie sich?

Wie groß ist eine Organisation:

- TBD: mention/explain disintermediation (Kontext: Plattformisierung)?
- Technological possibilities: Replacement of organizational hierarchies with markets (communities and individuals), growing importance of individual workers (@Stabell1998)

Also: everyone can create content/offer services over the Internet

Key insight, emphasize: expect smaller organizations!
-> also depends on regulation (antitrust laws)

e.g., to hire a worker (-> taylorism):
Search/Information: pre-Internet: send an announcement to the newspapers (money + time), Internet: post online
Bargaining and decision: Pre-Internet: organize meetings with candidate/decision makers (time), Internet: Zoom-meeting
Pricing and enforcement cost: pre-Internet: personal control/monitoring, Internet: even screen recording/people analytics
-> pricing: the Internet also allows us to source services globally/take advantage of global labor arbitrage.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Market-Hierarchy-Model.png
-> replace company/institution by organization


Over the last decades, information and communication technologies (ICT) such as the Internet have emerged, which enable low-cost communication and e-commerce on a global scale.

**Question**:  As a result of these developments, would you expect organizations to grow or shrink?


 Can we expect to work in larger or smaller organizations?

TODO : prepare a clear message:
- it becomes much cheaper to find, contract, and monitor (control/trust) external partners (even individuals)
- as a result, we may expect even further shifts towards smaller organizations/growing importance of individual work (at the same time: growth of platform businesses that serve as mediators / may not always be regulated well)

 -->

## The digital revolution

TODO

<!-- 

Shift towards remote work: interesting: 10-20 years ago, companies tried to persuade employees to "telework" (not successful). Today, employees ask for remote work.

- Organizational structures and management principles are often rooted in Taylorist assumptions (need to control, ...) - envisioning the future

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Analog_to_digital_transition.jpg

war for talent: McKinsey

- Growing bargaining power: Ageing populations
- "Arbeite-wo-du-willst-Job"

Examples: teachers, doctors

Examples for other disruptions (???)
- COVID: digitalization (e.g., home-office, web-shops, contact tracing, ...)

- Innovation and customization require a shift from traditional modes of control (monitoring, incentivizing, and sanctioning employees) towards value (co)-creation, cooperation, innovation (Wiener 2019) 

- Taylorism -> New work (market demands)
- [New work](https://www.avantgarde-experts.de/de/magazin/new-work) [link-2](https://www.zukunftsinstitut.de/dossier/megatrend-new-work/), [trends](https://karrierebibel.de/zukunft-der-arbeit/)

[[Future of work]]
 

dot-com boom (e-commerce etc.)

Note : competition on price is still there! But differentiation has emerged
example: Mobility (demand-oriented, pull)
The digialization shift is not over. (e.g., Blockhchain...)
tertiarization
innovation
gig-work (Wang/dialectics?)
implicitly: more complexity! (maybe illustrate with a car/manufacturing example: in 1950, there were 100 steps to build a car, today, there are 1000 steps to build the front lights of a car)

Adoption of Facebook/...
Platforms

turbulence/disruptive competition
TBD: disruptive inovation? / competition after market saturation / replacement of jobs, ...

 -->


## Knowledge work

knowledge work: need for generalists (moving away from an extreme division of labor) - craftsmanship / thinking in processes/outside the box
knowledge work focus: relevant for students/future jobs (although some believe "knowledge work" is not a useful distinction)

- Mention: digital technology/augmentation (e.g., drones for facility inspection, service logistics providers, coworking with robots, augmented reality, exoskelette, robot dogs)
TBD: cover blockchain? / decentralized workforce

- open work (open source, open innovation, ...)

Information Volume, overload, and the need to rethink (grant book)


## How should the future look like?

Should we work? -> **Maslow**: work: purpose/calling/self-fulfillment
TODO : maybe even add a chart of maslow: does work contradict self-fulfillment or should it coincide? What's the optimal time that people should work?

Mention: a little bit of an outlook

- challenges: Robots/AI/Automation taking care of many tasks (especially repetitive ones)
- What would the ideal world look like, what values would be important?
- How would you make it happen for yourself? Follow your passion?



## Bergman

Maslows pyramid of needs
 - idealy work should not be limited to safety: employment, but also address belonging, esteem, self-actualization (pushing ones boundaries)

How would we live if machines/automation/AI do all the work for us?
-> would we work at all?

smart consumption:
- saving resources
- easier to grow plants, fix/build things in smart environments

doing what you really want: life is short.

Mention that most issues raised in this lecture are part of a broader discourse (there are variations of positions)

Envisions centers for new work in which mentors help people to understand what they really want (e.g., art, ....)

https://newwork-newculture.dev/theorie/
Fokus: gesellschaftlicher Diskurs

Freiheit (Schaffen von Experimentierräumen, Schaffen einer Kultur der Angstfreiheit, starke Vernetzung innerhalb der Organisation)
Selbstverantwortung (Etablieren von Modellen der Selbstorganisation, Erweitern der Budget-Autorität, Etablieren von Beteiligungsmodellen)
Sinn („Arbeit, die man wirklich, wirklich will“, Erweitern des Wertschöpfungsbegriffs, Überprüfen von Strukturen und Prozessen)
Entwicklung (Etablieren kollektiver Lernstrukturen, Selbstreflexion der Organisation, Etablieren kollektiver Entscheidungsstrukturen)
Soziale Verantwortung (Ökologische und soziale Nachhaltigkeit, Regionales Engagement, Prinzip des Ehrbaren Kaufmanns)
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frithjof_Bergmann#New_Work


## Chetty

upward mobility: the "American Dream"

entrepreneurship/innovation: many Einsteins lost

There is saturation in average job prospects (compared to previous generations, across the working population)

## Newport

- why not follow your passion?

	- no evidence that we have a lot of suitable passions in the first place
	- passion as a by-product of skill (rather than a pre-condition)
	- having a rare and valuable skill is necessary to gain autonomy
	- satisfaction depends on autonomy, competence, and relatedness (Self-determination theory)

- focused on knowledge work

- It is about **rare skills*

Fokus: konkrete/individuelle Strategie

Passion is a side effect of skill/mastery

idea: matching skill and passion

think small, act big: 
- it is important to develop the overall vision
- you should not focus too much on specific jobs/positions
- it may be important to take risks, you have to do "self-marketing"

-> "follow your passion" can be a very risky approach ()

TODO : TED talk?s

|  | **Common Belief** | **Reality (Career Capital First)** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Step 1 | ❤️ Find your passion | 🔍 Explore interests and opportunities |
| Step 2 | 🎯 Choose career based on passion | 🛠️ Build rare and valuable skills |
| Step 3 | 🏆 Achieve success and happiness | ❤️ Passion grows as you gain mastery and impact |


## Conclusion

Organizations as collections of capital
Organizations as collections of resources
Organizations as collections of contracts
Organizations as collections of knowledge

Workers fight for safe jobs, fair wages
Workers fight for social insurance and leisure
Workers fight for meaning (self-fulfillment) and flexibility

It all depends on the industry (there are low-paying jobs that require no knowledge)

- MENTION Examples/imporant to make associations with the contents in the rest of the lecture.
