"I liked the fact that we were able to work very freely and independently on our problem as a group, but that we were always able to make appointments with Prof. Wagner at very short notice if we had problems or questions. This gave me the impression that we were working we were working *with* the lecturer on the problem and finding the best solution rather than blindly choosing the first solution that came along. In my opinion, working independently on a complex problem is the most important skill that I improved with the help of the project."<br><br>
"The support I received throughout the project was particularly good, as was the opportunity to deal with topics that were not previously available at the university, but which can be extremely important for your professional life." \[[more](evaluations.html)\]

## Consultation hours

I use the calendly tool to schedule meetings. It gives you an up-to-date overview of available slots in my schedule, and your reservations are immediately added to my calendar (no need to go back and forth via e-mail). We can meet in person or online, whatever works best for you.

## Goal and learning objectives

Upon completing the course, students will have an understanding of the changes, design areas, and impacts of digital work.
In particular, they will be able to explain and apply a repertoire of selected methods, design principles, and organizational policies in various situations.
Additionally, they will be able to discuss the evaluation of individual measures and effectively and responsibly apply them in practice with this background knowledge.

## Teaching approach

<!-- 
- **Complex Skill Development**: The project focuses on teaching complex skills necessary for modern software development. This includes tackling challenging problems, collaborative coding in teams, and managing a complex development environment using tools such as Python, Git, Continuous Integration, Testing Environments, and Code Quality Tools. To ensure a rich learning experience, we support students throughout the process by asking the right questions and providing the necessary input without removing the inherent challenges.

- **Real-World Impact**: We aim to empower students to make a meaningful impact by contributing to a real-world, publicly accessible Python package. This hands-on experience not only enhances technical skills but also provides a sense of accomplishment and relevance. Additionally, students can add this valuable experience to their CV, showcasing their practical contributions and teamwork skills to potential employers.

- **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion**: We are committed to creating a safe and inclusive learning environment where all students feel respected and valued. We create a positive learning atmosphere, encouraging questions and contributions from everyone. We encourage diversity and actively work to ensure that every student has equal opportunities to succeed and contribute.

- **Transparent Evaluation and Improvement**: Our [evaluation criteria](syllabus.html#assessment-and-grading-criteria), [course evaluations](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/handbook/docs/30-teaching/30_processes/30.21.evaluations.html#prior-evaluations){: target="_blank"} and [improvement efforts](https://digital-work-lab.github.io/handbook/docs/30-teaching/30_processes/30.22.improvements.html){: target="_blank"} are documented transparently. This ensures that students are aware of how their work is assessed and how the course evolves based on feedback and ongoing refinement efforts. In addition, we develop peer-reviewed teaching materials to solicit feedback from educators outside our program.
