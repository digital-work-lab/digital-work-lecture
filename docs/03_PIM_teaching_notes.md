TODO : summary slide (variance theory, explaining ... ) with learning-marker

TODO : recap the last session (open questions)

- [ ] Test the obsidian exercise before.

<!--

Our focus is on the high-level elements to expect and how to interpret the results. We do not focus on completing or evaluating the statistical analyses.

Identify key concepts in digital workplaces, explain them in a generalizable way, and describe examples of work practices.

Start with an open question: what counts in organizing digital workplace (more generally/beyond following specific processes like GTD)? 

--- 

## The digital workplace

- Objective: explain effective personal information management based on the PIME model and understand the different steps of the empirical study.

In the following: jump between the paper and the slides
-->

## PIM

- Background: Highlight that managing information is a key part of digital/knowledge work
Introduce elements of an empirical study (intro/background, model or theory/hypotheses, methods, results, discussion)

- Model development: the conceptual framework (figure 1), the synthesis of concepts from prior research (including definitions), the hypotheses (the full model)
- Subdimensions: developed based on prior literature
- Methods/ instruments: partially new
- (participants/demographics (population?), instruments: look at the appendix for an example)
- Introduce variables (definitions and what students would expect in each dimension) -
- Results: effect sizes (usually standardized/comparable - but better check)/significance (-> likely to result from chance?), explained variance, control variables (same as the other variable,s but ok if they are non-significant)
(ask: how would you interpret the model (before explaining the elements to students)) 


### Critical assessment

Selbstwahrnehmung und Korrelation (statt Experiment/klinischer Studie und Kausalität)

- Discussion/implications: TODO (check)
	- Critically discuss the study (correlation/limited knowledge on an intervention, self-reported ("compared to my co-worker, I perform well in my job overall..."))
	- Highlight generalizability (independence of particular technologies)
	- Interesting variables like proactiveness, sensing, processing, ...
	- Conceptual categories need to be translated into applications or practices

<div class="page-break"></div>

### PIME application:

We already covered collecting/organizing/processing in GTD. Focus on sensing and maintaining.


| PIME Capability | Practices    | Applications |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Sensing         |              |              |
| Collecting      |              |              |
| Organizing      |              |              |
| Processing      |              |              |
| Maintaining     |              |              |

**Task**: Form groups of three and fill out the table. What examples of applications and practices  for each capability?

Afterwards: extend the discussion to cover the broader workspace (collaboration, non-distraction environments, physical-digital workspaces)

Sensing:
- Practice: regularly (reading particular magazines, talking to people, listening to podcasts), setting up monitors to be notified of changes
- Applications: changedetection.io, ...
-> generally: applying a coding/testing mindset to organizing work/life (e.g., know when your websites are not available to proactively reach out/know what happens when customers ask, also query websites for particular events such as "coworking space closed today/construction works and noise" - to prevent unnecessary commutes/ monitor for twitter events/trends - have a coding/testing mindset, e.g., for academia: know what your colleagues publish, in marketing: know when competitors launch new campaigns, generally: sense fluctuation in demand)
Collecting: TODO
Organizing: TODO
Processing: TODO
Maintaining: TODO	

Ask students to read the paper (maybe skip a few elements in the methods/discussion)

## Beyond PIME

Think of applications and practices that are important in your work but not listed in the table. What are they and to which conceptual category do they belong? 

Introductory:

- Evernote, Wikis, ...
- Effectiveness: how it facilitates retrieval/knowledge recombination/output, how much it frees up mental capacity
- Interesting: the PIME/organizing refers to "classifying" (a notion of MECE) instead of second-brain approaches

Knowledge is a key asset.
Mentimeter:
- who organizes his/her knowledge in a systematic way?
- how do you organize you knowledge, which principles/systems do you use?
- how much room for improvement do you see?

E.g., mindmapping: how useful is if if we can't connect it to existing structures, refine it at more granular/higher levels?

- Start a mindmap exercise at the whiteboard, ask students about the key challenges and how they could be addressed by digital work methods/technology (state that this unorganized overload of information is typical for knowledge work/when starting a job).
- TBD: have students work in teams?
Better: make students think about how they would re-use/retrieve the materials from this lecture later on (e.g., in their job)
-> remembering in which slide can be challenging.
-> BUT: if we have organized it in a linear fasion, it is hard to extend it, connect it, and really get value out of it.

-  Raise the question of how to organize that kind of knowledge/information. Illustrate that entering everything in excel is not helpful because there are no connections/it is difficult to organize and retrieve information). - **TBD: maybe explain the principles in the next session?**

## Digital Gardening

Luhmann: extraordinary output (without a lot of phd students)
-> "Theorie der Gesellschaft; Laufzeit: 30 Jahre; Kosten: keine" https://www.ndr.de/geschichte/koepfe/Niklas-Luhmann-Der-Mann-mit-dem-Zettelkasten,luhmann100.html
Principles go back to Luhmann's Zettelkasten (Luhmann: sociologist who published 70 books and 400 papers, 90.000 index cards (on paper), worth millions of Euros)

Illustrate the notes (1, 2,3, adding 1a,1b, adding links)

Heterarchies: powerful when knowledge is complex, changes fast, and needs to be recombined (not useful for control/separation of concerns/MECE)

- (multiple representation formats and search cues)
-serendipity: unplanned fortunate discovery through multiple options for retrieval/analysis/associations (e.g., links, backlinks, tags, graph view, canvas)

Compare: excel/wiki

and autonomy 

- Exploratory affordances/flexibility of search perspectives

- Individual knowledge management (mention obsidian as an example of an emergent knowledge management tool  - explain the benefits, such as emergence of associations, multiple retrieval paths, ... -> key consideration in knowledge management: knowledge reuse -> hard to anticipate how we will search for the knowledge....)

[[Personal Knowledge Management System]]


- Suggest that the Internet (hyperlinked content) is pretty efficient, and then introduce obsidian as a relatively new/trending tool.
- Suggest to students that obsidian would also be a great example to prepare for exams (maybe even announce a reflection exercise at the end?)

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Exercise

Note : obsidian can be installed in CIP pool computers

When necessary: Illustrate markdown.

simple versioning
see [[obsidian]]
Obsidian (and similar tools): gaining in popularity

Markdown 101

- headings, lists, links, embeddings (figures, files, videos, formulas), comments, versioning

Other use cases: open-source documentation (e.g., on Github), academic writing, presentations.


- Show backlink - click on it to create new
- Show graph view in split-mode
- Show linked/unlinked mentions
- Show canvas

Obsidian:

Live illustration
[[obsidian]]

- provide a shot introduction into markdown/backlinks
- Mention: for literature reviews/theses (demonstrate: one window for writing/one for the notes)

- Start a (obsidian-based) mind-map (explain markdown syntax, especially links), similar to the seminar and ideally showcasing the emergence of concepts/structures (what are the challenges/how should we prepare?) interactively and then provide an intro into obsidian (managing a personal knowledge database).

- show [obsidian docs](https://help.obsidian.md/Obsidian/Index), interactive graph on the top right

**Obsidian Research**

Best Practice für Knoten, Tags, etc.

- Es bestehen keine generellen best pratices für den Aufbau, die Bennenung von Objekten oder sonstigen
- Es gibt von bestimmten Personen Tipps für Anfänger zum Aufbau der Obsidian App
- Es gibt auch Erklärungsvideos auf Youtube für Obsidian, hier sind ein paar Links zu relativ guten Erklärungsvideos:
- Erstes Video von einer Obsidian Serie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svqJ8BUh8mU
- Ein Starter Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88
- Vergleichsvideo von Obsidian mit Notion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNxr3KdiWac

Step setting goals: Note: Now, we have a classical hierarchy. But the links/serendipity of obsidian was already useful

Step 2: assess the courses
The list of courses is provided (as markdown files). Read through the contents and annotate the relevant contents (skills) using backlinks
-> If there are skills that cannot be covered by the university, suggest how Lisa could acquire those skills (e.g., complementary courses, or online materials)

The courses must be assigned to a semester. Remember that for some courses there are specific requirements (e.g., in the 3rd semester or later, required courses that need to be passed beforehand)
-> After all the preparation, please prepare a plan for Lisa. Add the courses to the canvas, create links, group the university courses into Semesters and assign the complementary courses (depending on availability/time).
