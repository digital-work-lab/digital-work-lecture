# Teaching notes: Communication

## GitLab: Choudhury et al. (2020)

Start: 10 Minutes to revisit your notes / compare with your neighbour

Explain p.3 / how it works:

- show the gitlab repository/merge requests (highlight > 100.000 merged)
- show decision rights: merge

Main challenges (after the background, p. 5-6, focusing particularly on the challenges relevant to organizational culture)

- p. 6 - Professional isolation (lack of informal mentoring, including **serendipitous** face-to-face interactions)
- p. 12 - Building a cohesive organizational culture (selection/onboarding/socialization, mentoring)
- p. 14 - Absence of colocation: may hinder organizational identification and the development of shared mental models (identification is important for motivation/effort, mental models: conducive organizational culture with strong norms/values)
<!-- - Maintaining a healthy work-life balance / avoiding emotional exhaustion -->
<!-- - Transparency of compensation (is cost-of-living adjustment fair?, finding out that one is paid less than coworkers can harm motivation) - GitLab somehow overcomes the "salary taboo" -->

Organizing principles

- Reduce coordination requirements (decomposability/minimum viable change, stigmergy: coordinate through the work product and environment, see what others are doing)
- Granting operational autonomy (not strategic autonomy)
- Input control ("selection at the gate" - select for abilities: structuring work days, digital skills,...)
-> Illustrate: control (the GitLab-CEO mentioned the differences between a consensus/hierarchical culture) - input (hiring), process (behavior: shared norms/mental models, process/documentation), output (progress reports/meetings ...)
- Detailed onboarding process
- Open and transparent documentation to build trust (remember: trust meta-analysis)

Boundary conditions

- Document-based/digital work (not work on physical goods)
- Visibility of the work process and outcome (for stigmergic coordination)
- Transparent compensation only works when contributions are easily observable
- Risks generated by transparency must be low (e.g., privacy concerns, regulatory requirements)

<!-- - Negative feedback loop: fewer "remote fit" workers <-> remote no longer perceived as special (incentive) -->
<!-- 
TBD: does it fit with the discussion/summary? - adopt a communication/collaboration/coordination perspective:

- asynchronous (convenient access without waiting across timezones)
- Transparent, accessible, linkable (contrary to e-mail, tacit group memory (ominous: we change the process / we use workarounds), links: within the docs and from outside)
- Collaboratively editable (-> comparison with Wikis) https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage/#wiki-handbooks-dont-scale
-->

{: .info }
> TODO : maybe extend the lecture to cover coordination?

<!-- 
- Distinguish synchronous from asynchronous communication settings. / Distinguish forms of synchronous and asynchronous collaborative content creation and select appropriate technologies.

 -->

## Media Synchronicity Theory

don't start with media richness theory (maybe a bit too challenging/differences to MST are more difficult to understand) 
Task: too broad -> MST: communication processes at a micro-level
Media synchronicity theory (Dennis, Fuller, and Valacich, 2006): 
- An influential theory in IS (citations, best paper awards)
- The theory explains communication (and task) performance based on the fit between media synchronicity, communication processe, and appropriation factors

**TODO : start with the fit aspect**

<!-- [[DennisFullerValacich2006]] -->

**Communication processes**

- Introduce the elements step-by-step:
- Communication processes: conveyance vs. convergence, which are more specific/smaller than tasks (MRT). also distinguish transmission from processing

**Media synchronicity**

- Media synchronicity: synchronous vs. asynchronous (definition)

**Media synchronicity requirements**

- Media synchronicity requirements for different communication processess (table 1, proposition P1) -> importance of **fit**

**Appropriation factors**

- Appropriation factors (**fit**)

**Examples I**

- **TODO : short exercise for the main concepts (communication processes, media synchronicity, appropriation factors, fit and communcation performance)**

**Media characteristics**

- Media characteristics: transmission and processing capabilities: construct figure 2 step-by-step (starting with the simple sender - medium - receiver model and then adding the different elements)

**Examples II**

- TODO : exercise: rate different communication media...

**Summary**

- refer back to HwangKettingerYi2015 and point out that DennisFullerValacich2006 stop at the hypothesis generation step (no empirical study)
- Derive implications
- TODO : application / exercise (short descriptions of scenarios, such as a team rejecting a certain application)
- TODO : collect and discuss best practices (e.g., signalling availability - are you red/orange/green?) / analyze based on MST (?) / don't cover conflict etc. too much - they are in lecture 7

# Homework

Read [external communication](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/communication/#external-communication){: target="_blank"}
 -->


## Examples/Applications

whiteboard: expands the symbol set, e.g., allowing participants to develop sketches or mathematical models. also increases parallelism (audio, video of participants, and video of whiteboard)
Video: increase symbol set (visual cues, gestures, reactions) - especially when meetings aim to converge on particular items. Appropriation factors: familiar with the challenges, perhaps even trained to increase video-use, could be due to past experiences, or even norms in the team or organization.
AI assistant: several features to transcribe, summarize, or sub-title meetings - improves reprocessability (during and after the meeting)
coding: Convergence requires high synchronicity, especially wrt. the symbol set of collaborative coding (synchronous) - e.g., [Visual Studio Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/services/live-share/){: target="_blank"}

## Theory of situational awareness:

What can the communication outcomes be?
e.g., reduce ambiguity, rally support for a project, foster inclusion and trust, discover private information, make decisions, prevent and resolve conflicts

Individual and task/environment factors at play (stress/complexity/technology)

Key message:
- Communication media and practices should be adapted to the situtation (many facets to consider, many potential outcomes to anticipate)
- Theories of fit may be particularly suitable, as exemplified by Media Synchronicity Theory

propositions...

**Examples**

- we have a short explanation video for that
- should we reschedule? should I brief you after the meeting?

## Communication at GitLab

Have students read the communication section in the Gitlab handbook:
- split students in x groups
- analyze sections, summarize guidelines as well as most surprising and most useful point (briefly present to the class)
- share short abstract with GW, GW: create a summary and share for exams


Communication settings

- Negotiate
- Converge
- Convey / present
- Learn/problem-solve (interactive vs. how-to)
- Cocreate (pair-program)
- Socialize
- Coordinate in small teams or broadcast

Discussion:

- Means of communication/best practices, policies/guidelines
- formalizing informal communication at Gitlab: examples
- Short educational videos/explanations
- Timing and choice of communication media (e.g., for conflicts)
- Symbol sets: screen sharing, virtual reality, direct collaboration on code
- synchronous: e.g., pair programming 
- Modes of collaboration (synchronous/asynchronous)
- Live session sharing (have students try it/visualstudio) - mention the Kude/ISR paper on pair programming?
- netiquette - be sensitive: all going well/busy time? (green/orange/red), meeting policy (remote meeting, ....)

- How to facilitate small-talk? Put something personal in the background. Ask for opinions/help
- How to connect? Humor? "Employee of the month" - not taking oneself too seriously... share your shortcomings/be vulnerable

-  Balance: efficiency (answer questions once/reprocessability), conflict, misunderstandings (task/relation)

Give and Take: Why Helping Others Drives Our Success

TBD: communities-of-practice (e.g., wikipedia on CSCW: awareness)

alternative exercise:
TBD: maybe give students 2-3 cases, have brief discussion, have them read different papers (MRT,MST,interruptions,conflict,team-leadership,learning/onboarding), and then discuss the cases from the perspective of different theories

Note: possible extensions:
- zoom-fatigue (what are the different forms of labor that make videoconferences exhausting?)
- Virtual impression management: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01492063231225160
