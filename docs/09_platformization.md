# Teaching notes: Platformization

The lecture took approx. 1.15h. **Need to extend**


## Summary of Cutolo and Kenney (reading/previous session)

PDE: Platform-dependent entrepreneur

Sources of power in platform owner-PDE relationship

- Techno-economic bases of platform power (intermediary, network effects, lock-in, "panoptic" control)
- Platform incentives and resources to PDEs
    - Access to customers
    - Provision of boundary resources
    - Platform governance

Consequences of the power imbalance: Risks for PDEs

- Separation from customers
- Algorithmic management: ratings, rankings, and recommendation systems
- Entry into the PDE's business
- Changing the terms of participation
- Platform access and delisting

PDE responses: Power balancing operations

- Multihoming (platform and channels)
- Income diversification
- Collective action
- Government action

Development of costs/risks/uncertainty over time

- From positive platform effects on startup to negative platform effects in the maturity stage
