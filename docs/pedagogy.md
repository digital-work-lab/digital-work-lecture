## Educational Philosophy

- Essentialism (Bagley, Hirsch): Focus on essential skills. Teacher-centered approach where educators direct learning and impart structured knowledge. Advocates a traditional, disciplined, and rigorous curriculum, emphasizing basic skills, and historical/cultural understanding. Believes that there is a fixed body of knowledge that all students should learn for a well-rounded education.
- Perennialism (Adler,  Hutchins): Focus on universal truths and intellectual development. Based on the idea that certain eternal truths and great works of literature, philosophy, and history are universally important. Emphasizes a classical education focusing on enduring themes and concepts, such as logic, ethics, and metaphysics (theory, philosophy of science, methods). The teacher's role is to expose students to these truths and guide them in rational thought and philosophical understanding. Advocates a structured curriculum that does not change much over time, focusing on what is believed to be essential for all people.
