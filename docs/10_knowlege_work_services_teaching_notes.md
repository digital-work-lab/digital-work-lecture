# Teaching notes: Knowledge-work services

## Summary of Cutolo and Kenney (reading/previous session)

PDE: Platform-dependent entrepreneur

Sources of power in platform owner-PDE relationship

- Techno-economic bases of platform power (intermediary, network effects, lock-in, "panoptic" control)
- Platform incentives and resources to PDEs
    - Access to customers
    - Provision of boundary resources
    - Platform governance

Consequences of the power imbalance: Risks for PDEs

- Separation from customers
- Algorithmic management: ratings, rankings, and recommendation systems
- Entry into the PDE's business
- Changing the terms of participation
- Platform access and delisting

PDE responses: Power balancing operations

- Multihoming (platform and channels)
- Income diversification
- Collective action
- Government action

Development of costs/risks/uncertainty over time

- From positive platform effects on startup to negative platform effects in the maturity stage

## Digital markets for knowledge-intensive services

- Trillion-dollar: Billionen

## Literature review method illustration (blackboard)

- Problem formulation: objectives / review type (describe / understand / explain / test) / scope and key terminology
- Search: scope / techniques: database search (keywords / searqch query), citation search, table-of-content-scan...
- Screen (prescreen: titles/abstracts - pdfs - screen based on pdfs)
- Synthesis (depending on the review type)

Announce that we will encounter challenges in each of the three steps (after problem formulation).

## Illustration on evidence-based searches

- basis: existing sample of included (relevant) and excluded (irrelevant) papers.
- current best practice (litsearchr): look for those terms that are common in the included papers and consider them as keywords
    E.g., digital platform / microsourcing
- problem: they could be equally predictive of irrelevant papers (illustrate by highlighting dots representing papers)
    - digital platform -> relevant (5%)
    - digital platform -> irrelevant (95%)
    - microsourcing -> relevant (100%)
    - microsourcing -> irrelevant (0%)
- more interesting question: what are the terms that predict inclusion? TERMS -> INCLUSION
<!-- - step further: query structure + genetic algorithm -->
-> key idea: it is equally important to consider irrelevant papers to identify effective queries
- how can we find the queries that are effective? (e.g., digital platform AND service ...)


## Illustrate small-scale statistics

Irish soccer fans (100.000) - business or tourists?

- small scale statistics: few research assistants distribute a survey

    - significance (e.g., 10x more business travelers as usual) is important!

- large scale statistics: all fans who have a smartphone fill out the survey (99.99%)

    - significance is not important (we have data on almost the entire population)
    - effect size matters! (2% more business travelers or 10x more?)
